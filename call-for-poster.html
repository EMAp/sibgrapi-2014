	<h1>Call for Poster</h1>
	
	<p>The 4th WIVIS Poster Track offers a timely venue to present and
discuss visualization research and applications through a forum that
encourages graphical presentation and in addition to a poster being
displayed throughout the workshop. Case studies in all application
areas are welcome. Examples of appropriate visualization work include,
but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>research exploring new problems or areas,</li>
<li>the results of student, pilot projects, work in progress, and</li>
<li>ew angles on existing (collections of) work or known data sets.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Submission instructions</h2>

<p>Poster authors must submit a two-page summary of their work in a
two-column format in line with the IEEE VIS formatting. Summaries can
be written in Portuguese although we encourage authors to submit in
English. It should include a concise description of the idea, the
results or findings, supporting imagery and figures, and a brief
discussion of the implications of the work to the selected
domain. Full literature searches are not expected, although relevant
citations should be included.</p>

<p>Please find formatting guidelines at:
<a href="ieeevis.org/year/2013/info/call-participation/posters">ieeevis.org/year/2013/info/call-participation/posters</a></p>

<p>Note that we adopt the submission format of Visweek 2013. Once the
summaries are not to be published, this could be considered as a forum
to discuss and further enhance your work to be submitted as a poster
for Visweek 2013, which deadline is June 27th, 2013.</p>

<h2>Important dates</h2>

<ul>
<li>Submission Deadline: May 10, 2013</li>
<li>Notification: May 17, 2013</li>
</ul>


<h2>Poster session</h2>

<p>Authors of accepted posters are required to bring an explanatory
hardcopy poster for display during the Workshop. They should be
available at the poster to discuss their work during the scheduled
poster session(s). The posters themselves have no predefined
formatting, but dimensions may not exceed A0 or A1 paper size. All
authors who plan to show live demos or video should bring a laptop to
the poster session and advise the organizers in order to have tables
provided.</p>

<h2>Poster review process</h2>

<p>Each poster submission will be read and evaluated by at least two
reviewers. Submissions will be evaluated according to originality,
significance, suitability for the venue (levels of interest,
relevance) and the potential for prompting discussion. All authors
will receive reviews of their submission explaining the decision and
providing feedback. Authors of posters that are accepted are expected
to address any recommendations and conditions of acceptance prior to
final submission.</p>

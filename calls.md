### Submission Instructions

All manuscripts submitted to SIBGRAPI 2014 must follow the IEEE LaTeX
recommendations. The SIBGRAPI IEEE LaTeX style will be available soon.
If the track to which you are submitting a manuscript requires
anonymity, then see details below in the Anonymity Requirements
section.

### Anonymity Requirements 

For the tracks in which the review process of submissions will be
double blind, authors must prepare their manuscripts without including
any indication of their identities or institutional
affiliations. Author's identities will be tracked only by the JEMS
submission system, and visible only by the track chairs. The program
committee members and referees who review the paper will not know the
identity of the authors.

To ensure anonymity of authorship, authors must prepare their
manuscript as follows:

Authors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or
elsewhere in the paper. Instead, please include under the title the
number assigned to your paper by the on-line paper registration system
(JEMS), for instance, by including the command \author{Paper id:
Manuscript number} in your LaTeX source file.  Funding sources must
not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.  Research group members or
other colleagues or collaborators must not be acknowledged anywhere in
the paper.  It is strongly suggested that the submitted file is named
with the assigned submission number. For example, if your assigned
paper number is 39352, then name your submitted file 39352.pdf.
Source file naming must also be done with care. For example, if your
name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi
file called Jane-Smith.dvi, one can infer your authorship by looking
into the PDF file.  The same rules apply to supplementary material.

You must also use care in referring to related past work, particularly
your own. For example, avoid mention to your work as "In our previous
work [1,2]...", prefer third person referencing as "In previous work
[1,2]...". Despite the anonymity requirements, you should still
include all relevant work of your own in the references, using the
above style (omitting them could potentially reveal your identity by
negation).

It is the responsibility of authors to do their best to preserve
anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise
potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to
immediate rejection.

**Abstract**: Computational Behaviour Analysis (CBA) is an emerging discipline that focuses on developing methods to study and understand behavioural phenotypes of humans with specific focus on health related applications. Examples of which are behaviour based screenings in Autism, skill assessment for Dementia patients or people with Parkinson's disease, or personalised rehabilitation support for stroke patients, to name but a few -- all with the objective of tailoring and improving individualised support. CBA is opportunistic regarding sensing modalities used for capturing human behaviour and apart from video based assessments Dr Ploetz and his team work with a multitude of sensors from the Pervasive and Ubiquitous computing domain. The focus of Ploetz's work is on developing and applying computational modelling techniques for CBA.

**Short-Bio:** Dr. Thomas Ploetz earned his PhD in Computer Science from Bielefeld University in Germany. His background is on machine learning and statistical pattern recognition.
Currently he is an Assoc. Prof. (Senior Lecturer) at the School of Computing Science at Newcastle University in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK where the Machine Learning and Activity Recognition research activities within the Digital Interaction group at Culture Lab. Prior to his appointment in Newcastle he worked as a visiting Research Fellow at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, USA, and as a post-doc in both Newcastle and TU Dortmund Universities (Dortmund, Germany).

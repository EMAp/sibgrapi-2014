title: Call for Tutorial Proposals
---

SIBGRAPI 2014 welcomes submissions of tutorials in all areas related to Computer Graphics (CG), Computer Vision (CV), Image Processing (IP), and Pattern Recognition (PR). 

All tutorials will take place in the first day of the conference (August 27th). A tutorial can take the whole day (6 hours long) or just half day (3 hours long), and can be elementary, intermediate, or advanced: 

- **Elementary tutorials** should complement the basic undergraduate curriculum in Computer Science, Engineering, and related areas, to introduce students into the selected topics. Instructors should not assume that the audience has basic knowledge in these areas. 

- **Intermediate tutorials** are targeted to students, professionals, and researchers who wish to learn specific techniques in CG, CV, IP, and PR. Instructors may assume that the attendees are familiar with basic notions of mathematics and programming related to the subject.

- **Advanced tutorials** should cover state-of-the-art research, recent developments, emerging topics, and novel applications in CG, CV, IP, and PR.

###Important Dates:

- Submission deadline: **March 25th, 2014**
- Notification of acceptance: January 15th, 2014
- Camera-ready survey paper: August 10th
- Handouts: August 20th

###Tutorial Selection

All proposals will be reviewed by at least two experts in the topic and will be judged by: 

-	Relevance for the conference; 
-	Expected size of the audience; 
-	Potential to attract participants to the conference;
-	Originality;
-	Qualification of the instructor(s) in the topic of the tutorial;

###Author's Instructions 

Tutorial proposals should be submitted through JEMS. The JEMS entry for tutorials will be available soon. Please, send your proposal up to 8 pages in PDF format using the SIBGRAPI IEEE LaTeX template available at the papers submission instructions page, disregarding recommendations for anonymity. The proposals should be written in Portuguese (elementary tutorials only) or English, and contain the following information:

-	Title
-	Level (elementary, intermediate or advanced)
-	How many hours will be required (3h or 6h);
-	Abstract;
-	Motivation;
-	Target audience;
-	Interest for the CV, IP, CG and PR community;
-	List of the topics to be presented, including:
-	Estimated duration, 
-	Subtopics, 
-	Relevant literature;
-	Presentation requirements: equipment and/or software;
-	Short biography of the instructors, including relevant experience in the topic of the tutorial;
-	Plan for presentation (include information on who will present the tutorial if more than one author).

Regarding the support for tutorials presenters, the organization intends to cover part of the hotel expenses, as well as the registration fee. 

###Presentation

Each tutorial must be presented by at least one of the authors (please include this information in the submission). Handouts must be prepared to be ready for distribution to the tutorials' participants. Instructions for the creation of the handouts will be given to the authors of the accepted tutorials at a later date.

###Publication of selected tutorial survey paper

Authors of the selected tutorials will be invited to prepare a survey paper, in the tutorial's topic, for the electronic version of the conference proceedings. We expect a survey paper in the form of a manuscript with an introduction, a structured presentation of the topic, and conclusions indicating trends, applications, and directions for future work. This paper will be peer reviewed for publication in a special issue of the journal RITA – Revista de Informática Teórica e Aplicada (see www.seer.ufrgs.br/index.php/rita/).

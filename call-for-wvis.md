title: Call for WVIS 2014 - 5th Workshop on Visual Analytics, Information Visualization and Scientific Visualization 
---

Motivated by the increasing attention worldwide on visualization
techniques, it took place during SIBGRAPI 2007, SIBGRAPI 2010,
SIBGRAPI 2012, and at Fundação Getúlio Vargas in 2013, the first four
workshops on "Interactive Visualization" (WiVis). As this area matures
worldwide, and the link between visualization techniques and analytics
tools gets stronger, we renamed the workshop to WVIS (Workshop on
Visual Analytics, Information Visualization and Scientific
Visualization).  In this edition of the workshop, we aim at providing
a forum for the dissemination of current work in the field, while
fostering new research and collaborations. The workshop will be
comprised of a poster session to promote discussions with the authors,
and two invited talks by well-known researchers in the field.

A list of suggested topics for papers include, but are not limited to:

- Visual representations and interaction techniques: focus+context,
  brushing and linking, coordinate multiple views, zooming,
  navigation, etc.
- Time-series analysis and visualization, streaming techniques for
  visualization, time-varying data analysis and visualization.
- High-dimensional data and dimensionality reduction applied to
  visualization problems.
- Mathematical foundations and algorithms for data transformations to
  allow interactive visual analysis.
- Layout arrangement: graph drawing, overlap removal methods, and
  small multiples visualization.
- Big data visualization: urban data, environmental data, etc.
- Visualization, rendering and manipulation of spatial data: scalar,
  vector and tensor fields, flow fields, regular and unstructured
  grids, etc.

### Invited Talks

WVIS 2014 will have 2 invited talks by well-known researchers in the
field. We are finishing arrangements with the invited speakers, and
notification of the names, titles and abstract of the talks will be
announced as soon as possible.

### Important Dates

- Paper submission: July 7th, 2014
- Notification of acceptance: July 17, 2014
- Final title and abstract due: July 24, 2014

### Submission Guidelines

All papers must be written in English and formatted according to the
IEEE standard (the same of the main conference). We welcome short
papers of 2-4 pages, including bibliography and illustrations. Since
the goal of this edition of the workshop is to promote the area of
visual analytics, information visualization and scientific
visualization, we strongly encourage the submission of promising
unpublished work, as well as high-quality published work in the
area. We strongly believe that the dissemination and discussion of
ideas will foster new collaborations and boost research in the area.

### Reviewing Process

All papers will be reviewed by the four chairs organizing WVIS 2014. We will be looking for promising and novel ideas in unpublished work, or high-quality published work. The chairs will prepare a short summary of the evaluation for all papers submitted, and eventually suggest minor corrections for accepted submissions. Since we are considering unpublished and published work, in this edition of WVIS the accepted submissions will not have a formal publication, but instead will have have their paper title and abstract published in the web-page of the event. The authors of accepted papers will present their work in a fast forward session (1-2 mins), and a poster presentation session (1 hour). Instructions for the fast-forward session, as well as poster guidelines, will be given upon the notification of accepted papers.

### Preliminary Agenda

fast-forward session on Friday, August 29th.

title: Call for Technical Paper Contributions
---

Original unpublished papers are invited. All manuscripts submitted to
SIBGRAPI 2014 Technical Paper Track must be in English and should not
exceed 8 pages to be prepared following the SIBGRAPI IEEE format
available below.

## Important Dates:

- Full Paper Submission: April 25, 2014
- Notification of Acceptance: June 15, 2014
- Camera ready due: June 30, 2014

SIBGRAPI 2014 submission deadline is hard. Differently from previous
years, there will be no extensions!

## Submission Guidelines:

All full papers are to be double blindly reviewed by at least three
experts in the topic of the work. All papers recommended by the
reviewers will be accepted.

The final program will only include papers with at least one author
registered in the AUTHOR category in the conference. All papers
included in the proceedings of the conference are submitted to IEEE
Xplore, and scheduled for oral or poster presentation.  SIBGRAPI’s
proceedings are available on-line at
[IEEE Xplore](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome.jsp?punumber=1000131)
and also at the [SIBGRAPI Digital Library Archive]
(sibgrapi.sid.inpe.br) maintained by Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas
Espaciais (INPE, Brazil).

As in previous SIBGRAPI editions, the program committee is working to
have authors of the best papers invited to submit extended versions of
their work to highly ranked international journals in the respective
fields. In particular, extended versions of the best papers of
previous SIBGRAPI were published in special issues of:

- Image and Vision Computing (2003)
- Pattern Analysis and Applications (2004)
- Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics (2004)
- Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision (2006, 2011, 2012)
- Pattern Recognition Letters (2007, 2008)
- Computers & Graphics (2007)
- Computer Graphics Forum (2007, 2009, 2012)
- International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (2010)
- The Visual Computer (2010)


## Submission Instructions

The SIBGRAPI IEEE LaTeX style is available below:

- zip package will be available soon!

Please follow the included instructions and the IEEE formatting
guidelines, avoiding any change to the format (in particular avoiding
**\vspace** command, or creating subsections or paragraph title with
any command different from **\subsection** or **\paragraph**).

The bibliography should be formatted with a 9pt font. Please do not
change the font size, even if it helps to comply with the page limit!
The paper length may vary depending on the track you are submitting
the paper. Please check the respective calls for the maximum allowed
number of pages for each track. The illustrations of the paper should
be generated either truly vectorial or rasterized with at least
300dpi.

Paper submission will be handled via CMT system: available soon!

## Oral presentation

The oral presentations must fit in 20 minutes, with additional 5
minutes for questions. Slides should be prepared in English. Authors
may use the SIBGRAPI 2014 oral presentation template available soon.
 
## Poster presentation

Posters should be prepared using an area of 90cm x 120 cm at maximum
and in a portrait orientation. The use of small font size is not
recommended. There is no need to submit the poster in the submission
system. Authors may follow the SIBGRAPI 2014 poster template
(available soon).

## Anonymity Requirements 

Once the review process of submissions will be double blind, authors
must prepare their manuscripts without including any indication of
their identities or institutional affiliations. Author's identities
will be tracked only by the submission system, and visible only by the
track chairs. The program committee members and referees who review
the paper will not know the identity of the authors.

To ensure anonymity of authorship, authors must prepare their
manuscript as follows:

- Authors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or
  elsewhere in the paper. Instead, please include under the title the
  number assigned to your paper by the on-line paper registration
  system, for instance, by including the command \author{Paper id:
  Manuscript number} in your LaTeX source file.

- Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.

- Research group members or other colleagues or collaborators must not
  be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.

- It is strongly suggested that the submitted file is named with the
  assigned submission number. For example, if your assigned paper
  number is 39352, then name your submitted file 39352.pdf.

- Source file naming must also be done with care. For example, if your
  name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi
  file called Jane-Smith.dvi, one can infer your authorship by looking
  into the PDF file.

- The same rules apply to supplementary material.
 
You must also use care in referring to related past work, particularly
your own. For example, avoid mention to your work as "In our previous
work [1,2]...", prefer third person referencing as "In previous work
[1,2]...". Despite the anonymity requirements, you should still
include all relevant work of your own in the references, using the
above style (omitting them could potentially reveal your identity by
negation).  It is the responsibility of authors to do their best to
preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or
otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject
to immediate rejection.

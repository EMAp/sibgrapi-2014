### Call for Workshop Proposals

SIBGRAPI - Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (formerly
Brazilian Symposium on Computer Graphics and Image Processing) is a
traditional forum bringing together researchers, students and
professionals in Computer Graphics, Image Processing, Computer Vision,
Pattern Recognition and related areas. It is annually promoted by the
Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) through its CEGRAPI committee. The
conference started in 1988 as a small symposium and has grown in
importance along the years.

The 27th SIBGRAPI is being organized by EMAp/FGV, the School of
Applied Mathematics of Get√∫lio Vargas Foundation, and will be held on
August 27-30, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
 
We are inviting proposals for workshops, to be held as special
sessions of the conference.

The purpose of these workshops is to provide participants with an
informal setting for discussing innovative work on important new
technical directions. Workshops should last 4-6 hours, and will be
scheduled for August 30th.  Although the organizers determine the
format of the workshop, it is recommended to reserve substantial time
for discussion, and that aspect will be considered in the selection
process.

Proposals for workshops should be at most 2-3 pages in length and
should contain:

- Title
- Area of interest
- A brief description of the workshop technical issues
- The relevance and novelty of the workshop
- Contact information of the organizing committee. This committee
  should consist of at least three experts in the field, not all from
  the same institution. One of the members should be identified as the
  contact person.
- Estimate of the audience size and composition, including background.
- Format and agenda.
- Procedures for selecting papers or other types of work, if
  applicable.
- A list of audio-visual or technical requirements.
- The budget of the workshop: it should include information about
  existing funding for the planned activities and what have to be
  included in the SIBGRAPI general budget.

Workshops proposals should be submitted as a pdf file sent by e-mail
to the chairs:

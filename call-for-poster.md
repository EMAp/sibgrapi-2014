All accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the conference (submitted to IEEE Xplore) 
and scheduled for oral or poster presentation.

From 1997 to 2008, SIBGRAPI proceedings were published by the IEEE Computer Science, 
by CPS since then, and since 1996, at the SIBGRAPI Digital Library Archive, maintained 
by Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE).

In previous SIBGRAPI editions, the authors of the best papers were be invited to submit 
extended versions of their work to highly ranked international journals in the respective fields. 
In particular, extended versions of the best papers of previous SIBGRAPI were published in special issues of:

Image and Vision Computing (2003),
Pattern Analysis and Applications (2004),
Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics (2004),
Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision (2006),
Pattern Recognition Letters (2007, 2008),
Computers & Graphics (2007),
Computer Graphics Forum (2007, 2009),
International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (2010),
The Visual Computer (2010).

## Submission instructions

To be announced...

## Anonymity Requirement

The review process of most submissions will be double blind. 
Authors must thus prepare their manuscripts without including any indication 
of their identities or institutional affiliations. Authors’ identities will be 
tracked only by the JEMS submission system, and visible only by the track chairs. 
The program committee members and referees who review the paper will not know the identity of the authors. 

To ensure anonymity of authorship, authors must prepare their manuscript as follows:
Authors’ names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper. 
Instead, please include under the title the number assigned to your paper by the on-line paper 
registration system (to be announced).
Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.
Research group members or other colleagues or collaborators must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.
It is strongly suggested that the submitted file is named with the assigned submission number. 
For example, if your assigned paper number is 39352, then name your submitted file 39352.pdf.
Source file naming must also be done with care. For example, if your name is Jane Smith and 
you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi file called Jane-Smith.dvi, one can infer your 
authorship by looking into the PDF file.
The same rules apply to supplementary material.
You must also use care in referring to related past work, particularly your own. 
For example, avoid mention to your work as “In our previous work [1,2]…”, prefer third person referencing 
as “In previous work [1,2]…”. Despite the anonymity requirements, you should still include all relevant 
work of your own in the references, using the above style (omitting them could potentially reveal your 
identity by negation). 

It is the responsibility of authors to do their best to preserve anonymity. 
Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, 
are subject to immediate rejection.

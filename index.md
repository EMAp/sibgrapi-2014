The field of visualization encompasses the study of applications,
techniques and algorithms for producing visual representations of data
coming from various sources, as well as tools supporting the
interactive exploration or analysis of such (often voluminous)
datasets. In this context, many problems have to be solved, including
acquisition, storage, communication, computational analysis, human
perception and human-computer interaction issues. Scientific
visualization, data visualization, information visualization, visual
simulation, exploratory visual analysis, visual data mining, and more
recently, visual analytics have been used to distinguish research and
development involving interactive data visualization.

Since the 1st Workshop on Interactive Visualization, held during
SIBGRAPI 2007, the field has evolved and gained importance
globally. The 2nd and 3rd Workshops on Interactive Visualization were
held during SIBGRAPI 2010 and SIBGRAPI 2012, respectively. These
previous editions focused mainly on group presentations.  With this
4th edition of the workshop as a satellite of the
[WVC 2013](http://www2.ic.uff.br/~wvc2013/) (Workshop de Visão
Computacional), we expect to reach other researchers while still
providing a forum for the discussion of current projects in Brazil,
fostering exchange and cooperation between groups.

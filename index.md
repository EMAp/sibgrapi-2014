SIBGRAPI 2012 - Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (formerly Brazilian Symposium on Computer Graphics 
and Image Processing) is the 27th edition of this conference annually promoted by the 
Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) through its special interest group on Graphics and Image Processing (CEGRAPI). 
The conference started in 1988 as small symposium (“Simpósio Brasileiro de Computação Gráfica e 
Processamento de Imagens”) and has grown in importance each year. 
The proceedings are available at the SIBGRAPI Digital Library Archive, maintained by 
Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE). 
From 1997 to 2008, the proceedings were published by IEEE Computer Society Press. 
Since 2009, they have been published by CPS. All these editions are available at IEEE Xplore. 
Moreover, since 2003, special efforts have been made to publish extended versions of the 
best papers in special issues of well-qualified journals of the related areas. 
Information on past SIBGRAPI events can also be found at the CEGRAPI committee page.

SIBGRAPI 2014 will be held on August 27-30, in Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

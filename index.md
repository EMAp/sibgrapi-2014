SIBGRAPI 2014 - Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (formerly
Brazilian Symposium on Computer Graphics and Image Processing) is the
27th edition of this conference annually promoted by the Brazilian
Computer Society ([SBC](http://www.sbc.org.br/)) through its special
interest group on Graphics and Image Processing
([CEGRAPI](http://www.imago.ufpr.br/cegrapi/)). The conference started
in 1988 as small symposium (“Simpósio Brasileiro de Computação Gráfica
e Processamento de Imagens”) and has grown in importance each
year. The proceedings are available at the
[SIBGRAPI Digital Library Archive](http://sibgrapi.sid.inpe.br/),
maintained by Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE). From
1997 to 2008, the proceedings were published by IEEE Computer Society
Press. Since 2009, they have been published by CPS. All these editions
are available at IEEE Xplore. Moreover, since 2003, special efforts
have been made to publish extended versions of the best papers in
special issues of well-qualified journals of the related
areas. Information on past SIBGRAPI events can also be found at the
CEGRAPI committee page.

SIBGRAPI 2014 will be held on August 27-30, at
[FGV/EMAp](http://emap.fgv.br/) , the School for Applied Mathematics
at Getulio Vargas Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Researchers, students and professionals are invited to participate by
submitting works in all areas of Computer Graphics, Image Processing,
Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. Visit the Call for Papers
page for further information.

title: Call for Workshop of Undergraduate Works
---

Welcome to the 12th edition of the Workshop of Undergraduate Works
(WUW) of SIBGRAPI 2014. The main goals of WUW are to motivate
undergraduate students involved in research projects on Computer
Graphics and Image Processing to attend and present their works at the
SIBGRAPI conference; and to provide opportunities and environment for
undergraduate students to discuss their research with other students
and experts in the area. Works may be submitted by any student
currently enrolled in an undergraduate program or who have graduated
in the last 12 months. The work can be individual or in group, but
must have a professor responsible for the research. Thus, each paper
must have at least two authors. Accepted works should be presented in
poster sessions and will be published in the SIBGRAPI Electronic
Proceedings (with ISSN), provided that at least one author student has
registered to the event.  Important Dates

### Important Dates:

- **(EXTENDED)** Submission Deadline: **June 8, 2014**

### Best Paper Selection

Awards will be given for the three best works, presented at the WUW
poster session by one of the author students. Awarded authors will
receive a certificate, as well as a special recommendation for the
work publication at
[REIC - Revista Eletrônica de Iniciação Científica](http://seer.ufrgs.br/reic),
an electronic journal published by SBC.

### Work Selection

The WUW program committee will evaluate the submitted works with
regard to the following criteria: originality, technical quality,
contribution of the research and presentation.

### Submission Guidelines

Submissions can be written in Portuguese or English, and the text
should follow the SIBGRAPI 2014 formatting guidelines for full papers,
but with the following adjustments. The names of the authors should
not be omitted, disregarding the requirement of anonymity for the
articles. In particular, students must appear as the first authors and
the advisor as the last author, with eventual co-advisors and other
collaborators in the middle. Texts in Portuguese should include, after
the abstract in Portuguese, also an abstract in English. Articles are
limited to 6 double-column pages. Papers should be submitted through
the JEMS system. Please go to the submission instructions' page for
further information.

### Posters Preparation

Posters should be prepared using an area of 90cm x 120 cm at maximum
and in a portrait orientation. The use of small fonts on the text
production is not recommended. It is not necessary to include the
poster in the JEMS system.

---

SIBGRAPI - Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (formerly
Brazilian Symposium on Computer Graphics and Image Processing) is a
traditional forum bringing together researchers, students and
professionals in Computer Graphics, Image Processing, Computer Vision,
Pattern Recognition and related areas. It is annually promoted by the
Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) through its CEGRAPI committee. The
conference started in 1988 as a small symposium and has grown in
importance along the years. The last five SIBGRAPI editions are listed
below.

SIBGRAPI committees though the years works to have authors of the best
papers invited to submit extended versions of their work to highly
ranked international journals in the respective fields. In particular,
extended versions of the best papers of previous SIBGRAPI were
published in special issues of the following Scientific Journals:

- Image and Vision Computing (2003)
- Pattern Analysis and Applications (2004)
- Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics (2004)
- Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision (2006, 2011)
- Pattern Recognition Letters (2007, 2008, 2012)
- Computers & Graphics (2007, 2012)
- Computer Graphics Forum (2007, 2009, 2012)
- International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (2010)
- The Visual Computer (2010)

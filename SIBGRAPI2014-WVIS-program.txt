title: WVIS - 5th Workshop on Visual Analytics, Information Visualization and Scientific Visualization 
---

Motivated by the increasing attention worldwide on visualization
techniques, it took place during SIBGRAPI 2007, SIBGRAPI 2010,
SIBGRAPI 2012, and at Fundação Getúlio Vargas in 2013, the first four
workshops on "Interactive Visualization" (WiVis). As this area matures
worldwide, and the link between visualization techniques and analytics
tools gets stronger, we renamed the workshop to WVIS (Workshop on
Visual Analytics, Information Visualization and Scientific
Visualization).  In this edition of the workshop, we aim at providing
a forum for the dissemination of current work in the field, while
fostering new research and collaborations.

### Preliminary Agenda

The workshop will be held on 30 August 2014.

08:35 &ndash; 10:00 Keynote 1: [Tim Dwyer](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~tdwyer/), Monash University, Australia.

10:00 &ndash; 11:00 Poster session/ Coffee-break

11:00 &ndash; 12:30 Keynote 2: [Helwig Hauser](http://www.ii.uib.no/vis/team/hauser/), University of Bergen, Norway.

### Building a useful software dependency visualization system

## WVIS invited speaker: [Tim Dwyer](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~tdwyer/), Monash University, Australia. 
  
- Saturday, August 30
- 8:30 - 10:00
- Room: FGV´s Cultural Centre

**Abstract**: I have been an information visualization and graph drawing researcher for the better part of 13 years so was therefore excited at the opportunity to build a "practical" graph-visualization tool with the weight and resources of a powerful software company behind me.  However, I soon discovered that algorithms for layout and analysis are only one small piece in the puzzle to build a practical visualization tool that people will actually like and use.  In this talk I hope to share that journey, some of the insights we acquired along the way, and---of course---spruik the tool itself: CodeMaps in the Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 IDE.
 
**Short-Bio:** Since 2012 Tim Dwyer is a Senior Lecturer and Larkins Fellow with the Faculty of IT at Monash University.  From 2009 to 2012 he was a Senior Software Development Engineer with the Visual Studio group at Microsoft, USA.  From 2008 to 2009 he was a Visiting Researcher with the VIBE group at Microsoft Research, USA.  He was a Research Fellow at Monash University from 2005 to 2008 and received his PhD from the University of Sydney in 2005.

### Keynote 2: To be announced

## WVIS invited speaker: [Helwig Hauser](http://www.ii.uib.no/vis/team/hauser/), University of Bergen, Norway.
  
- Saturday, August 30
- 11:00 - 12:30
- Room: FGV´s Cultural Centre

**Abstract**: To be announced
 
**Short-Bio:** Helwig Hauser graduated from Vienna University of Technology, Austria, in 1995 with the degree of a ''Dipl.-Ing.'' (~MSc) in computer science.  In 1998, after research on flow visualization, he received the degree of a ''Dr.techn.'' (~PhD) from the same university. In 2004, Helwig Hauser was entitled a ''Privatdozent'' at the Vienna University of Technology after his successful Habilitation.  In 2006, he was awarded with the prestigous Heinz Zemanek Award for this work. Since 2007, Helwig Hauser is professor at the University of Bergen, Norway, where he is leading the (still young) research group on visualization.  Helwig Hauser's interests are diverse in visualization and computer graphics, including interactive visual analysis, illustrative visualization, and the combination of scientific and information visualization, as well as many other related topics.  He is also particularly interested in the application of visualization to the fields of medicine, geoscience, climatology, biology, engineering, and others.

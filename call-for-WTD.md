---

The Workshop of Theses and Dissertations (WTD) aims to motivate
discussions about the graduate-level research on topics covered by
SIBGRAPI among graduate students, recently graduated students, and
senior researchers. Researchers who have recently concluded their
graduate studies are cordially invited to submit a paper to the
SIBGRAPI WTD. Graduate works in progress are welcome for submission to
the Workshop of Works in Progress (WIP).

### Important Dates

- (**EXTENDED**) Paper submission deadline: **May 16th, 2014**
- Notification of acceptance: June 23th, 2014
- Camera ready: July 14th, 2014

### Who can submit?

Students who defended their M.Sc or Ph.D. after 01/01/2013 and did not
present their final work at previous editions of the SIBGRAPI WTD.

### Selection criteria

The WTD program committee will evaluate the submitted works with
respect to the following criteria: originality, technical quality,
contribution to the research area, and clarity of presentation.

### Best work awards

A number of awards for the best Ph.D. and M.Sc. works will be given
based on the selected work grades and on the opinion of a small
committee that will evaluate the poster presentations during the
event. In order to participate of the contest for the best work
awards, the paper must be written in English.

### Instruction to the authors

Submissions related to M.Sc. work may be written in Portuguese or
English, using the IEEE Latex file format. However, we strongly
recommend paper submission in English. Submissions related to
Ph.D. work must be written in English using this 
[IEEE Latex file format](http://emap.fgv.br/sibgrapi-2014/files/2014-sibgrapi-latex-template.zip). 
The text should follow the SIBGRAPI formatting guidelines, but with the following adjustments:

- The names of the authors should not be omitted, disregarding the
  requirement of anonymity for the articles. In particular, students
  must appear as the first author and the advisor as the last author,
  with eventual co-advisors and other collaborators in the middle.

- Texts in Portuguese (only M.Sc.work) should include, besides the
  abstract in Portuguese, also an abstract in English.

- The articles are limited to 6 â€“ double-column pages.

- The text should indicate, by a footnote on the first page, whether
  the work relates to a M.Sc. dissertation or a Ph.D. thesis.

- Awards, patents, publications or possible distinctions achieved as a
  result of the M.Sc. dissertation or the Ph.D. thesis should be
  listed in the last section of the paper.

- The papers should be submitted through the
  [CMT system](https://cmt2.research.microsoft.com/WTD20142014/Default.aspx).

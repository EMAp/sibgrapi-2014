### Instruction to the authors

Submissions related to M.Sc. work may be written in Portuguese or
English, using the IEEE Latex file format. However, we strongly
recommend paper submission in English. Submissions related to
Ph.D. work must be written in English using this 
[IEEE Latex file format](http://emap.fgv.br/sibgrapi-2014/files/2014-sibgrapi-latex-template.zip). 
The text should follow the SIBGRAPI formatting guidelines, but with the following adjustments:

- The names of the authors should not be omitted, disregarding the
  requirement of anonymity for the articles. In particular, students
  must appear as the first author and the advisor as the last author,
  with eventual co-advisors and other collaborators in the middle.

- Texts in Portuguese (only M.Sc.work) should include, besides the
  abstract in Portuguese, also an abstract in English.

- The articles are limited to 6 – double-column pages.

- The text should indicate, by a footnote on the first page, whether
  the work relates to a M.Sc. dissertation or a Ph.D. thesis.

- Awards, patents, publications or possible distinctions achieved as a
  result of the M.Sc. dissertation or the Ph.D. thesis should be
  listed in the last section of the paper.

- The papers should be submitted through the
  [CMT system](https://cmt2.research.microsoft.com/WTD20142014/Default.aspx).
  
- Posters are to be printed in A1 format size, portrait orientation. There isn´t a template to be used as reference.
